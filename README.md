# Eye-Flue-Detection
The symptoms, including redness, itching, discharge, and potential vision problems, highlight the importance of early
identification for discomfort alleviation and prevention of complications. Traditional diagnostic methods may lack the
needed accuracy for intervention, prompting our research to employ deep learning techniques inspired by brain networks.
• Our approach, detailed in this report, focuses on creating a reliable automated system, EyeFlueGuard, accessible through a
user-friendly website. This platform enables individuals to conveniently assess their risk of eye flu by uploading eye
images, receiving predictions, and accessing materials for seeking appropriate medical assistance. The examination covers
data gathering, organization, model building, and testing, aiming to redefine disease diagnosis and contribute to early-stage
identification.
• This healthcare advancement demonstrates our commitment to utilizing intelligence for public health enhancement.
EyeFlueGuard exemplifies the convergence of technology and medicine, showcasing how AI can effectively detect and
manage eye infections at an early stage, impacting both short-term eye health and the broader integration of AI in
healthcare diagnostics.

Objective:

• The EyeFlueGuard initiative employs advanced learning techniques for early detection and management of eye flu.
With a focus on developing a cutting-edge model and analyzing datasets, the goal is to empower individuals for prompt
risk assessment, intervention, and reduced infection spread.
• The user-friendly EyeFlueGuard website enables easy eye image uploads, emphasizing a smooth experience,
accessibility, privacy, and security. Beyond detection, the initiative raises eye health awareness, providing materials on
symptoms, preventive measures, and the importance of consulting medical experts, fostering cooperation with
healthcare professionals and aiming for a comprehensive solution.
